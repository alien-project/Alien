# Alien
Incomplete implementation of the Improved Alien algorithm.

## Running example

This implementation is in a form of a Python package. Therefore, if you want to try the example, then you need to install the package locally and run the script in the example folder.

1. You must be in the main folder of the project.
2. Install the package locally: ``$ pip install .``
3. Run the example: ``python3 examples/frozenlake-v0.py``

## Additional info

1. At the beginning of the invention of the algorithm, strategy was called "storithm" and internal state was called "memory". That's why in the code you can't see the name "strategy" and "internal state" but "storithm" and "memory".
